## Description

This is a simple project I did in my spare time where the goal was to create a web app using React, TypeScript and Webpack without using tools like Create React App.

Github Actions was also used to automate issues such as deployment, code checking and other processes related to code change.

## Usage

Use the node package manager to install the dependencies: `npm i`.

Then, you can launch the dev server by executing `npm start`

And the last step is to check your browser at `http://localhost:8080/` to start making your changes :)

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Good to Know

This library works with SSR (Server Side Rendering, aka Universal Application).
